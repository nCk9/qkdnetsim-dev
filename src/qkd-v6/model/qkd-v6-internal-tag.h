 * \ingroup qkd
 * \class QKDv6CommandTag
 * \brief QKDv6CommandTag is used to describe the content of the packet payload.
 *  
 * QKDv6CommandTag is used in routing protocols to mark the packet that needs to be 
 * analyzed further from L4 layer. For example, we mark DSDV packet using this Tag,
 * by using "SetCommand('R')" and "SetRoutingProtocolNumber(DSDV_PACKET_HEADER_PROTOCOL_NUMBER)"
 * Later, in QCrypto by analyzing the tag we know that the packet contains DSDV headers
 * that needs to be encrypted. Without the tag, there is no way to know what is inside TCP/UDP payload.
 * Tag is removed after encryption.
 * If the tag has some other value, such as "SetCommand('A')" it is not a routing packet, 
 * and the payload of the TCP/UDP header is encrypted as it is. 
 *
 * \note This mechanism is mandatory since in the NS-3 simulator, we cannot provide the packet 
 * with all its headers and payload in a simple array of bytes or simmilar (version 3.29).
