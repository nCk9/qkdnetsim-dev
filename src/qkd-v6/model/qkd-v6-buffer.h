/**
 * \ingroup qkd
 * \class QKDv6Buffer
 * \brief QKD buffer (storage) that keeps QKD keys. QKDv6Buffer is assigned for each link using
 *  QKDManager on each side of the link (each node). That is, two QKDv6Buffers for one link. 
 *
 *  \note Due to the limited key rate, the links are organized in the following way: both
 *  endpoints of the corresponding link have key storages (QKD buffers) with limited capacity
 *  which are gradually filled with the new key material, which is subsequently used for
 *  the encryption/decryption of the data flow. The QKD devices constantly generate keys
 *  at their maximum key rate until the key storages are filled. The type of the used
 *  encryption algorithm and the amount of network traffic to be encrypted determines the
 *  speed of emptying the key storage, often referred as the key consumption rate, while the
 *  key rate of the link determines the key charging rate. If there is no enough of
 *  the stored key material, the encryption of the data flow cannot be performed and the
 *  link can be characterized as “currently unavailable”. QKD buffer can be in one of the following states:
 *  READY, WARNING, CHARGING, EMTPY.
 *  The states of QKD buffer do not directly affect the communication, but it can be used for 
 *  easier prioritization of traffic depending on the state of the buffer. For example, in EMPTY state, 
 *  QKD post-processing application used to establish a new key material should have the highest 
 *  priority in traffic processing.
